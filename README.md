# Strap
A script to bootstrap a minimal macOS development system. This does not assume you're doing Ruby/Rails/web development but installs the minimal set of software every macOS developer will want.

## Motivation
Replacing [Boxen](https://github.com/boxen/boxen/) in [GitHub](https://github.com/) with a better tool. This post outlines the problems with Boxen and requirements for Strap and other tools used by GitHub: https://mikemcquaid.com/2016/06/15/replacing-boxen/

## Features
- Disables Java in Safari (for better security)
- Enables the macOS screensaver password immediately (for better security)
- Enables the macOS application firewall (for better security)
- Adds a `Found this computer?` message to the login screen (for machine recovery)
- Enables full-disk encryption and saves the FileVault Recovery Key to the Desktop (for better security)
- Installs the Xcode Command Line Tools (for compilers and Unix tools)
- Agree to the Xcode license (for using compilers without prompts)
- Installs [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) (for installing command-line software)
- Installs [Homebrew Bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) (for `bundler`-like `Brewfile` support)
- Installs [Homebrew Services](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-services) (for managing Homebrew-installed services)
- Installs [Homebrew Cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask) (for installing graphical software)
- Installs the latest macOS software updates (for better security)
- Installs dotfiles from a user's `https://github.com/username/dotfiles` repository and runs `script/setup` to configure them.
- Installs software from a user's `Brewfile` in their `https://github.com/username/homebrew-brewfile` repository or `.Brewfile` in their home directory.
- A simple web application to set Git's name, email and GitHub token (needs authorized on any organisations you wish to access)
- Idempotent

## Out of Scope Features
- Enabling any network services by default (instead enable them when needed)
- Installing Homebrew formulae by default for everyone in an organisation (install them with `Brewfile`s in project repositories instead of mandating formulae for the whole organisation)
- Opting-out of any macOS updates (Apple's security updates and macOS updates are there for a reason)
- Disabling security features (these are a minimal set of best practises)
- Add phone number to security screen message (want to avoid prompting users for information on installation)

## Usage
Open https://macos-strap.herokuapp.com/ in your web browser.

Instead, to run Strap locally run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap
cd strap
bash bin/strap.sh # or bash bin/strap.sh --debug for more debugging output
```

Instead, to run the web application locally run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap
cd strap
GITHUB_KEY="..." GITHUB_SECRET="..." ./script/server
```

Instead, to deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) click:

## Web Application Configuration Environment Variables
- `GITHUB_KEY`: the GitHub.com Application Client ID.
- `GITHUB_SECRET`: the GitHub.com Application Client Secret.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: the secret used for cookie session storage.
- `WEB_CONCURRENCY`: the number of Unicorn (web server) processes to run (defaults to 3).
- `STRAP_ISSUES_URL`: the URL where users should file issues (defaults to https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/issues/new).
- `STRAP_BEFORE_INSTALL`: instructions displayed in the web application for users to follow before installing Strap (wrapped in `<li>` tags).
- `CUSTOM_HOMEBREW_TAP`: an optional Homebrew tap to install with `brew tap`. Specify multiple arguments to brew tap by separating values with spaces.
- `CUSTOM_BREW_COMMAND`: a single `brew` command that is run after all other stages have completed.

## Status
Stable and in active development.
